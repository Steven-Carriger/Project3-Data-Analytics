# Project3-Data-Analytics
Data Analytics project where I work to create an application using a prediction model I learned.

This project uses a polynomial regression model to predict if a person has malignant or benign prostate cancer based on the dimensions of certain features of the growth.

It is recommended to download the project and use visual studio code with python 3, Flask, and html installed in the extensions tab. You will need to install 
various libraries such as sklearn, pickle, numpy, and flask for the project to work as well.
